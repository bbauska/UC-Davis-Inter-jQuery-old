The &lt;head&gt; of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded. It contains information such 
as the page <b>title</b>, links to glossary("CSS")
(if you choose to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and other metadata (data about the HTML, such as the author, and 
important keywords that describe the document). Web browsers use information contained in the {&lt;head&gt;  to render the HTML document correctly. 
In this article we'll cover all of the above and more, in order to give you a good basis for working with markup.

<h3>About this Course</h3>

This course is the third in our JavaScript for Beginners Specialization. The scripts will become more complex and introduce more complex jQuery 
plugins. You will have several challenges to practice your skills throughout the course. The course objectives include how to identify objects 
in JavaScript; create new objects and populate them with data; manipulate objects by adding, modifying and deleting data in objects; manipulate 
the DOM based on the data in objects; identify and articulate how multiple functions work together to create a more complex program; and identify 
processes for breaking larger programs into smaller, more manageable pieces.

<h2>Syllabus</h2>

## Week 1.01. Course Introduction (0:40)
 
Hello and welcome to our 3rd course in our four-core specialization on JavaScript. My name is Bill Mead and I'm back again to do more JavaScript with you. 
Hopefully you've completed our first two courses on JavaScript and you've learned a lot about the syntax of JavaScript and how to solve problems with 
JavaScript. It takes a lot of practice to get good at this stuff. 
I'm back again to do more with you to introduce some new concepts, to do some new projects and to do some more sophisticated projects and give you even 
more practice. You get even better with JavaScript and JQuery. We're going to do a lot in this course. Let's break out our code editors and our web 
browsers and get started and learn even more about JavaScript.
 
Hello and welcome to our first module in our third course on JavaScript. In this module, we're going to dive even deeper into jQuery, looking at some 
jQuery plugins. You've already made some sliders in a previous lesson. But in this lesson, we'll look at the flex slider plugin, which adds a lot of 
features, two sliders and comparing that to what you've done manually by creating your own sliders is really instructive and useful. Plus, you end up 
with a great tool for creating slider elements on web pages and that's really pretty fun.

## Week 1.02. Introduction to jQuery Plugins (3:49)
 
Just as a quick recap, we've learned a lot of JavaScript so far. 
 
We started with the JavaScript basics, which included working with variables, flow control structures like if statements and else statements and loops, 
and that stuff. We created reusable functions that you can use in multiple projects or you can use multiple times within the same project. We've manipulated 
the DOM and handled events such as when somebody clicks on something or hovers a mouse over something, we can capture those events and then do things with 
them. With these basics, you can do quite a lot, but it might take you a long time to write the scripts that you want to do for your web page. 
 
Then we had jQuery and your world became a little bit larger. With jQuery, we've learned that there are a lot of helper functions built into this library 
that make writing scripts shorter and a little bit more compact, and a little bit easier. That helps and that makes things a little bit easier and a little 
bit better for all of us. 
 
Now we need to introduce plugins. We've already used the easing plugin, which is a very simple plugin that adds additional function to jQuery, so that you 
can use different types of easing, which is different speeds and ways in which things can animate on your screen, and by plugging in that particular 
plugin, you get access to all of those different features that aren't built into jQuery. 
jQuery has this plugin architecture that's very powerful, that allows developers to build extensions to jQuery. They give it a lot of additional functionality. 
There are tons of jQuery plugins available, thousands of them, and I recommend looking around the web and seeing what other ones you can find. We will look 
at one or two here in this course, but there are just thousands of them out there and they're really worth exploring and seeing what's out there. That way 
your world becomes a lot bigger because now you don't only have to just write all your scripts yourself. You can look for scripts that other people have 
written and see if you can modify them and use them in your own projects through the use of a plugin, and that's really very powerful and really great. 
 
Again, plugins add additional functionality to jQuery, and we've already seen this with the easing plugin. But some plugins can have very complex 
functionality without us having to write a whole bunch of code. We have access to a whole bunch of additional functions and we'll see what that 
looks like. You can create whole interfaces in a jQuery plugin, and then by providing that plugin, other people can have access to those interfaces. 
For example, we did the project where we made the tabbed interface. What if there was a jQuery plugin that made hooking up a tabbed interface super 
easy? There are plugins for those things and they might come with a lot of features and functionality. What if you want the tabs to run down the 
side of the tabbed interface rather than across the tab? You could do that thing.
 
Using plugins and essential steps, adding plugins to your project, configuring them, and learning how to use them still takes some work and effort. 
But not nearly as much work and effort as it takes to write the whole script yourself. 
Many of the larger, more sophisticated plugins require five steps to get them to work. 
 
Step 1 is, you have to use the markup indicated by the plugin documentation. Often, you'll have to use divs or our articles or other elements with 
particular classes that the plugin needs in order for it to actually work. Classes or IDs or other, structures that the plugin needs for to work.
Step 2, you need to make sure jQuery is linked. The jQuery libraries linked because if you're using a jQuery plugin, then you need to have jQuery 
decide if you're going to put your scripts at the top of the page or at the bottom of the page. Sometimes you can put them whichever place you want, 
sometimes the plugin directions will tell you to put them in one place or the other. But frequently you can make your own decision on this and put 
it where you want it to go and architect your file the way you want it to be structured. 
Step 3, is to link the plugin file and when you download a plugin, frequently it will come with a compressed version and an uncompressed version. 
The uncompressed version is there for you to look at so you could see how the plugin actually functions, it's readable JavaScript, and you can do 
that kind of thing. But when you're ready to put it into your project and for your production ready project, you want to use the compressed version 
because it will be smaller, and it'll download faster. So if they provide a compressed one, then you should use that, if they don't provide a 
compressed one, you can compress it yourself. 
Step 4, link to the plug in CSS file, some of the fancier plugins will come with styling that will style the elements inside of the plugin. And, 
this is usually included so that everything looks and works the way it's supposed to work within the interface for that plugin, so you want to 
make sure you get that CSS file linked onto your page. 
Then Step 5, is you need to initialize the setup of the plugin in your own script tag, or on your own linked JavaScript file. Often, you can set 
additional options so that when the function is initialized, and so that you can pass in whichever options will get the plugin to display the way 
you want it to display, but you want to make sure that this script loads last. So, the order of things are that you will have the jQuery plugin, 
then you'll have jQuery, then the jQuery plugin, and then you will initialize the plug in on your own script. And then also make sure that if 
there's any CSS files, those are included as well. 
 
Documentation Mish-Mash
Suppose you find a jQuery plugin you want to try on your website, how do you go about adding it to your page? How do you know what to do? 
Because these plugins are all made by different developers or groups of developers, there's no real standard in terms of the documentation. 
So, this is where having a solid foundation in JavaScript really helps, because you need to look at the documentation they provide, and be 
able to tease it out and go okay, I understand what they're asking me to do here. 
On this page they're telling me to install the plugin like this and then add these configuration options, and so on and so forth. And unless 
you have some experience with JavaScript, it's going to look like a bunch of messy code and it's not going to make a lot of sense. So that's 
why it's really helpful to have a solid JavaScript foundation, before trying to mess around with this stuff. But now that you do, and you'll 
see once you work with a few plugins that many of them work pretty much the same way. The documentation may look a little bit different; the 
directions may be written a little bit different, but it's the same basic steps each time.

 
Gotchas and rookie mistakes. 
 
Number 1 on this list is the biggest one, I see this all the time, especially with students who are new to working with JavaScript in jQuery, 
and that is ending up with multiple copies of the jQuery library linked to your page. Only load the jQuery library once. You may have multiple 
plugins, but you should only load one copy of the jQuery library, which is used by all the plugins. What happens is you find a plugin that add 
some interesting functionality web page. You follow the directions and load the jQuery library and do all the directions to make that plugin 
work. Then you find another plugin that does something else that you want to use. You follow the directions and that page and it tells you 
to load the jQuery library and to load the plugins. You follow those directions and then in the end, you end up with the jQuery library loaded twice. 
Frequently, when you download these plugins, they'll include a copy of the jQuery library. You'll follow the directions, you'll link up one, 
then you'll think of another. It turns out that the two plugins hooked up actually are using different versions of the same jQuery library. 
Now you've got two different versions of the jQuery library linked up, and that's going to cause all problems and things will break and it 
won't work right. You want to make sure you only ever have one copy of the jQuery library plugin. I'm saying this now, but I promise it'll 
happen. How I see this is the most common error that I see from students who are working with jQuery is the follow the directions and they 
wind up with multiple copies, different versions of the jQuery library plugged in. That's the number 1 Gotcha. It happens a lot. 
The second thing is file management. When you download a plugin, sometimes plugins require other files, whether it's CSS files or maybe an 
images folder, fonts or something else. You want to make sure that when you put those files in your folder, everything is going into the 
correct spot and is linked properly. Because for the web, remember, everything is linked. All the files are linked to each other. If those 
links become broken, then your project won't work and it won't work properly. Make sure you have all the correct files and all the correct 
places for the plugin to work. That's number 2, those two issues comprise 90 percent of the problems that people have with plugins, it's 
probably those two problems. 
The next thing (number 3) is top of the page versus bottom of the page. Make sure you're placing your plugins scripts in the correct place. 
Some of them may require you to load jQuery up at the top of the page. Usually, you can put them where you want as long as you run the scripts 
properly. 
But make sure you have a strategy for where your JavaScript is going to load, whether you're going to have it load at the bottom of the page 
before the closing body tag, or whether you're going to put the links to scripts up in the top of the page and maybe use the defer attribute 
to make sure they don't load into the whole page is loaded. Keep that in mind. 
Now, jQuery has a document ready method that will check to see that the DOM is flooded before anything inside the document ready function 
runs. That's just checking to make sure your HTML is loaded. Sometimes people will provide plugins and tell you to use the document ready 
function. You'll need that if you're up at the top of the page and you're not using the deferred attribute. But if you put it at the bottom 
of the page, you may not need it. There's also a window load method, and that's in older versions of jQuery version 2 and lower. It's now 
been replaced with window.on and the load and you pass in load as the event that we're looking for and then run an anonymous function, which 
is what we used in the previous lesson with the sliders. Be aware about these different functions, what they do, which versions of jQuery 
they work with and that stuff, because if you're reading the documentation for a plugin, it could be older documentation. If their 
documentation is telling you to use window.load, but you're using the most recent version of the jQuery library, you'll have to switch it 
to the window.on method and use that one instead. You want to make sure that you're using these functions properly. Really where you're 
going to use these is just where you're initializing your script. Has nothing to do with loading the actual script file or the plugin file. 
This is where you initialize your script on your page where you're tying the plugin to run. You'll need to make sure you use these functions properly. 
Then number 5 is overriding CSS on your stylesheet. If you want to customize the look of the plugin and you should put your rules that 
override the styles they've set on their specified CSS file, on your CSS file and then make sure your CSS file loads last. That way, when 
your access loads, it will override the access on their stylesheet. You don't want to overwrite the styles on their access file because 
if you ever update the plugin files, you'll lose that and you'll have to do it again. You want to make sure you put it on your CSS file. 
 
Beware the plug in
One last topic that I have to talk about before we're done with this lecture and plugins is just to beware of the plug in. Plugins can 
add bloat to your project with a lot of additional code that you may not need. All of the features, plugged features that are programmed 
into the plugin, but you may be only using one or two. That's something to be aware of. Without modification, plugins can make your site 
look generic, so if you're not updating the CSS file or adding your own styles to it, then it could look the same as everybody else's website. 
Plugins can turn us into lazy designers looking for a quick fix. Rather than actually trying to solve our interaction design problem, we 
go look for a plugin that looks cool and interesting. That may not really be the right fit for a project just to avoid having to do some 
custom code. Watch out for that. 
Also, plugins can be poorly written. They can have all bugs built into them because they're made by other developers. You don't really 
know. You really have to test them out and research them, find out who else is using them, what problems if they had, what sorts of 
things work well with them. It'll take time to do the research, but probably less time than actually writing the code yourself from 
scratch if it's an extensive plugin. It's worth it to make sure that the plugin you're using is really worthwhile. 
 
Looking to the future
Getting used to using other people's code now via jQuery plugins is a good preparation for the future. If you get deeper into JavaScript 
coding, we might use other repositories of shared code, such as NPM, which is the world's largest software registry. Then having experience 
with jQuery plug ins will really help you out. It's very common in the software development world to be working on modularized blocks 
of code and working with plugins can be seen as an introduction to that way of thinking and working where you're taking functionality 
and separating it out into a separate file and then plugging it in. You have access to that. It's a really great way of thinking and 
working with JavaScript in jQuery in general and getting used to that here will help prepare you for a future as a JavaScript developer.

FlexSlider jQuery Slider plugin. Now that we've talked about jQuery plug-ins a bit, let's take a look at one that we can use to add a 
significant amount of interface options to our page. 
 
The FlexSlider is a good one to look at. Partially because we've been working on image sliders, so, we come to this with the context 
of having created some sliders on our own, so, we can see what this particular plug-in has offered that's different from what we 
coated ourselves in the previous lessons. That's fun. 
The other thing that's nice about FlexSlider, it's called FlexSlider because it's a responsive slider. 
   
I've opened up the page over here and you can see if I pull this off and resize it, the page is responsive and it squishes and 
stretches, and so, we can actually create a slider that will work for different screen sizes using FlexSlider. That's fun. 
 
If you look at the markup, you'll notice that it's pretty basic. If you download the start files that come with this lesson, 
I have in here some basic markup. 
   
This is where the actual slider will go, and then I've just got some columns and some articles, and then the styling is all 
in place on the CSS file that includes some media queries for when the screen gets larger or smaller. The media queries, 
will handle the sizing of stuff on the page, and there's just a few rules in there just because this is pretty basic, but 
there we have it. We'll make a slider about kittens because, who doesn't love kittens? Kittens are awesome. 
 
We looked at the media queries and they'll handle the screen if it's wider than 600 pixels. Up to 600 pixels you just get 
a very basic layout, and then once you get larger than that, it will give you a more of a layout on the page with the columns. Okay. 
 
Then the next thing is the FlexSlider Website and the FlexSlider Script. 
 
If you go to the FlexSlider Website, which is here, you can download FlexSlider or you can click on the Live Demo. It's 
posted by WooCommerce and they have the basic directions here with some additional functionality that we'll look at, and 
this is the documentation for how to use FlexSlider right here on this page, and you can download the files to get started. 
However, I've already provided the same files with this lesson, so, you don't have to go there and download them, they're 
also included with this lesson. 
 
Get those files first by either clicking the Download button here or by downloading the FlexSlider files of this lesson. 
 
Now, when you get those files, the FlexSlider files, you're going to need to figure out what you need in order to actually 
make the FlexSlider work in your project. This is a little bit confusing, especially if you're not that familiar with this 
thing. Let me go through it carefully, because you're likely to run into this with other plug-ins as well. 
   
Here on the left, I have my folder with my website in it, that's my index page, I've got a JavaScript file, I've got slides 
which have different slides for the different pictures of the kittens, and I've got my style-sheet, that's what's in my folder. 
   
Over here, these are the files that got downloaded. When I unzipped the FlexSlider folder this is what I got. You might 
wonder what some of this stuff is, bower-components and bower.json. Bower is a build tool that's used to combine stuff 
together, so, we can ignore those. The change-log will show different versions of the program, composer is a different 
build tool, contributing is another file that talks about it. If you look in the CSS folder, you'll see there's a bunch 
of ‘less’ files that compile down into basic CSS files, so, we don't need that. The Demo will run to show the Demos of 
the different versions of the FlexSlider, so, you don't need those files, but you can look at them if you want to. 
Then we've got some files down here. We've got a less version, we've got a CSS, we got an rtl.css and rtl-min.css, 
fonts, images, all this stuff. 
Really the only things that we need in our folder are the actual plugin and we want the minified version, notice 
here, the non-minified version is 57KB, the minified version is less than half of that in size. We want people to 
have to download the smallest file possible. We need the CSS file and we're actually going to need this fonts folder. 
The fonts folder includes a font that as the next button in the previous button that will show up on the slider, so, 
we need that in order for this ‘next’ and ‘previous’ buttons to load properly. We will need that as well. 
   
I'm going to grab the FlexSlider.css, the fonts, and the minified version of FlexSlider. Just those three files, the rest of it I don't need. I'm going to put them into my project folder over here so that I have them, and that gets us all the files that we need in order to get started for this project.
 
About the Minified Version
And again, I'm just repeating myself here but it's really important that you understand this. The Minified version is 
the same file with all the same with all the white space removed and a few other things done to make the file smaller 
and faster to download. Use that version if it's available for any plug in that you want to use. The non-modified 
version is available if you want to see the actual Javascript or maybe even edited, but you'll probably never want 
to do that. So, we'll always use the Minified version. And again, these are the files that we actually need for our 
project. So, we're going to copy them over and put them into our project folder just like you see here and just like 
we did just a minute ago in the previous video. Next, it's about following the directions to make the flex slider 
work, and you can come back to the flex slider website and I recommend that you do this. Even though I'm going to 
walk through doing it with you, it's good to sort of come in here and see how these directions are written and to 
understand what the steps are. First, link the files, then add the markup, then hook up your slider, and then tailor 
it's units with special stuff down here. And if you're new to this, this may look a little bit confusing and difficult, 
but it's really not. And also it may be written differently for different plug ins. So, it's important to know a little 
bit about how Javascript works in order to get this stuff to work, right? Once you've done it a few times for a few 
different plug ins, you'll see there's a lot of similarities. All right, so let's go through this together. So, you 
can see what I mean about how to do this. First, we can look at where these scripts go, and over here, notice this 
one is listing jQuery 1.6.2, that's a really old version of jQuery. And then we've got the flex slider Js here, we've 
got the CSS file. I'd rather load up the most recent version of jQuery rather than the old version of jQuery. So, let's 
go over to our files over here. And on our index page, up at the top of the page, this is where we want to put a link 
to the flex slider CSS. So, I'm just going to add a link here, link href = " flexslider.css". Don't forget 
rel="stylesheet", and make sure you spell style sheet right. Okay, so that will link that up. You can see I've got 
jquery 2.2.4 loaded here, as opposed to the 1.6. But I'm actually going to load the most recent version of jQuery. 
So, I'm going to come back here and I'm going to go and look for jquery cdn in google, Google Hosted Libraries. 
I'm going to go find jquery. And here is the latest version of jquery. You'll notice it's been updated recently 
to 3.6, okay. So, I'm going to replace this version of jquery with that one. But notice I need to go back and add 
the differ, I want to put differ back in here because really I want this script to load at the bottom of the screen. 
Okay, now I want to load the jQuery Flexslider script. So, I'm going to put that in here, script src equals quote, and 
I want this one, that's the plug in. I'm going to load that one next, and then I've got my script file here and it's 
currently empty, but I want to load that file last, script as we are seeing, equals quote myscript.js. There we go, 
I've got the files loaded. So, what's the next thing that we need to do? If we come back to the directions, it says 
place somewhere in the head of your document. The other thing I want to do is I want to put the deffer attribute on 
my script. Let's do that too. Because we want to make sure that it loads after the jQuery library. So, I want to put 
deffer here, and deffer down here. So, that they will load in this order, first this library, then the plug in, then 
my script. And they'll load after the rest of the page is loaded, just to be certain. So, we've got that, okay. The 
next thing we need to do is to add the markup, and this is the markup this plug in expects. It expects a div with 
the class, flexslider, and a ul with the class slides, then list items with the images inside of it, and we'll do 
that in the next video.
 
In the last video, we got all of our files linked and everything hooked up so that it should all be ready to work. You want to make sure that your stylesheet loads after the FlexSlider style sheets, that you can modify changes there. We'll get to more on that later. Now, we're ready to actually come down here and make our markup work the way it's supposed to work. If we come back to our slides and our directions, it says to make the markup look like this. This is what we need to do. This is what this particular script requires. It requires a div with the class of FlexSlider and unordered list of the class of slides, and then we can actually put our images inside each list item for that unordered list. Let's go over here and set this up the same way. We need a div, we need a class, equals FlexSlider on here. This needs a class equals slides. Then down here, we can have list items with our different pictures in here, and I'm just going to copy this one and paste it. Over here in the folder, I have slides and I have seven of them. I have seven kittens here. Let's go ahead and add the six more times. 1,2,3,4,5,6, and then just change these numbers, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. That will give us seven slides with seven kittens, one on each side. That's great. Now we've got our markup looking the way that it needs to look for our project. What's the next thing that we need to do? We did the markup, we got that all in, so that's great. Step 3, directions. Hook up the FlexSlider. This thing says to use the window.load function. Now, I happen to know that the window.load function does not work with the latest version of jQuery, but that's okay. This is what it says down here. We could just copy this, window.load function here. This place after these links, script type JavaScript. But we're going to put this not inside script tags, but we already have a separate file called MyScript that's linked up here. That's this one here. I'm going to put it on there, MyScript. Take FlexSlider and make it run. This says jQuery, go get this FlexSlider element, dot FlexSlider. Remember, we put that class on the FlexSlider and run the FlexSlider function here. Now, this function exists because we have the plug-in. The plug-in is defining this function. This is in addition to jQuery and it wouldn't exist otherwise. We're putting it inside window load because we want to make sure all the images offloaded before we can actually start making the slider run. So we want to make that happen first. But I happen to know that this isn't going to work because the window.load function is deprecated and they want us to use window.on instead. But let's just test it anyway. If I come over here and refresh this page, you'll notice the FlexSlider is not here. If I do inspect and then come over to the console, index self is not a function. If you're seeing this stuff where the problem is actually in the jQuery library, jquery.min.js:2, function load, this is a really good indicator that something's wrong with jQuery itself. It's not anything we did. It's actually jQuery. What's wrong here is that the latest version of jQuery does not support this file. Now, if I were to go back to my hosted libraries and take this one instead, and come back here and replace it, you'll see that it'll work if I put this up here instead of the newest version. When I put that in there, put my defer back in, and now if I go test the page, you'll see that it works. Close this, refresh. Look at that, we have a kitten slider, and it's working, I get my errors, I get these buttons down here, so I've got this additional functionality, and it's working. It's doing everything it's supposed to do. But what if I really want to have the latest version of jQuery? Well, this is where knowing a little bit of JavaScript and a little bit of jQuery really helps, because I know that this load method here has been replaced. It's been deprecated. You could go look that up on the jQuery website if you wanted to. But I'm going to come back here and I'm going to command Z and put this back to the version 3.6 and save that. Over here instead of load I'm going to use on, and in here, I'm going to put in load as an event and then run the function and watch this. That should work. Make sure both files are saved, come back and refresh and look at that, it works fine using the on method, the more up-to-date method. Okay, great. Now, while we're here, let me just do one other thing. Suppose I forgot something. This is the thing that is often forgotten here is what if I forgot to include this fonts folder in my files? I'm going to move that to the trash. Come back here and refresh this. Use these boxes instead of the arrows. That's what that fonts thing is actually doing. It's just providing the fonts there. Could you do something other than those arrows? Yes, you can. You can customize the slider so it doesn't use those arrows. But for right now, let's just leave it at the default, which means I want to leave these arrows, that fonts folder back over there because the script is making use of that in order to put those arrows on the page. There they are, they're back again. Okay, great. We've got the basic slider working, now we can talk about what else we need to do with it and we'll do that in the next video.
 
In the last video, we got the Flexslider working, and it's working great. It's functional. All the pieces are functioning, but it's got some weird issues that we need to fix in terms of the layout in the styling. For example, why is my Flexslider sticking out on the edge over here? What's up with this gap? What if I wanted to change the color of these dots down here? These are things that I can adjust if I start poking around in the CSS. If I right click on this and choose "Inspect", I'll get my inspector up over here and I can actually see if I come in here to "My Class" Flexslider here that it's got some margin on it here. Let's see what else does it have here? I think the slides maybe somewhere there's some, where is it? Oh, it's got this border. Border for pixel solid. If I had checked that, I can see that's causing that gap right there. It's doing some weird stuff that we can fix. If we want to adjust that, we can make a rule on our own style sheet that attaches to dot Flexslider. We don't want to adjust their style sheet. If I wanted to get rid of that border, I could go poking around in these files for the jQuery Flexslider CSS. That's the actual minimized file. There was the Flexslider CSS. I could go poking around in here and see if I can make changes here, but I don't want to do that because if I ever update this slider script to a newer version, I don't want to lose any changes that I've made. This is one of the main reasons why I want to make sure that my CSS file loads after their CSS file because if I can add a rule on my CSS file that says dot Flexslider, then I can override the rule over here. What do I want to do over there to do that? I want to rule for dot Flexslider, I want to set the margin to this zero 20 pixels. Zero on the top and bottom, 20 pixels in the left and right, border none, border radius zero. That will clear out some of those styles and clean-up the styling of the actual Flexslider. Let's go ahead and add that to ours. How do I know that? Just by poking around in their CSS file. I want to make sure I'm on my CSS file, which is where? There we go. Then somewhere in here you can put it wherever you want, it doesn't really matter. Make sure it goes above the media queries. I'm going to make a comment here that says, "Flexslider styles" and in here I can make a real dot Flexslider. Margin I want it zero in the top and bottom and 20 pixels in left and right, I want border;none. No border at all and border radius zero to give it square edges. Just with that one rule in place here, if I come back and check my page, you'll notice the Flexslider looks better here. It's fitting into the space well, and I've got rid of that gap and all that stuff. Down here, I still want to adjust these buttons a little bit. I mean, inspect again. Maybe move my inspector to the side and it's this thing here, dot flex-control-paging li a.flex-active. That's the class that's changing the colors on these buttons here. That's the one that I want to actually attach to. I'm going to come over here, I'm going to add that rule in here. If I want a different color, what did I put on my slides over here? I put pound B40205, make it match that. What was it? Just color or is it background? Background: #B40205. There we go. That will give me a red background color. Save that and come back and test it. You can see my colors now overriding the color that was there before and I can go ahead and click on these things and they all work. That's great. You want to put styling on your own style sheet that will override styles on the Flexslider's CSS to customize it, to make it look the way you want it to look. Finding out what those styles are, or just a matter of using the inspector and hunting around to see what rules are being applied that you might want to change to get it to style and look the way you want it to look on your page.
 
Your slider should be looking good. We've gotten everything in place and it's working. It's functional and it looks good and we've adjusted the CSS and all that kind of fun stuff. That's really great. It's a lot easier to do this with just a few lines of code, than having to write all of this functionality ourselves, especially since you've seen how to make a slider. We didn't include this functionality for being able to have these buttons down here, being able to go to slides that way. We could have done that manually on our own, but with this plug in, it provides it for us automatically and that's great. Now, what about all these additional options that show up down here at the bottom of the screen? There's all this stuff down here, and we can use this to further customize the functionality of our FlexSlider. That's really cool, but how do you do it? It's not really clear by looking at this exactly what you need to do. But basically what we need to do is we need to pass options in to this FlexSlider
method here, this FlexSlider method here. We pass them in in the form of an object because
these things here are look like key value pairs that you can pass into an object. It would be really nice if
they made it really clear on exactly how to do this
here on the instructions, but if you know some
JavaScript and you're familiar with having done this kind of thing before, you'll figure it out pretty quickly. What can we do? Let's take a look at it. Just like we did with the custom enemy method in jQuery, where we can pass in an object, curly brace, curly brace, and then we can pass in these key value pairs to get the slider to do some different things. Let's give that a try. I know we haven't really talked a lot about objects yet, and we will get into that in more depth in a lesson coming up. For right now, we'll just kind of go with it and get used to the syntax because we'll see it a lot, especially with the plugins. Let's come over here and inside our script file here, inside our parentheses here, we're going to add a set of curly braces. Then inside these curly braces, we can add different settings. What are the settings that we can add? Well, there are these settings over here. For example, if you wanted to do animations slide you can set it here, set your animation fade or slide. By default, it's doing fade. Over here, when we go from slide to slide, it's fading from slide to slide. It's doing a fade in fade out. But if we wanted to actually do a slide, we can change that to animation slide. You can take this, copy it, and then come over to your script and stick this in here, and change this to slide. Get rid of the comma, because we only have the one here. If I do that, you'll notice over here immediately. Refresh, when I click on the next thing, instead of fading it's sliding. Look at that, it loops around. You don't have to do any special programming for that, it's all built right into the plug in. You remember what a trouble that was for us to figure out how to do manually. Well, here it's built in, so we don't have to really even worry about that. What else can we do? Over here, I had slide, you can set the speed, slideshow speed. That's in here. Slideshows speed. Slide, comma, for each one of these in here, you have to put a comma at the end, except for the last one. I'm not going to set it to seven seconds that would be really long. I'm going to set it to two seconds. That will tell us how quickly it's going to slide from slide to slide automatically. One two, one two, there we go. Now it's going rather quickly, that's great. What else can we do? We could do direction vertical, if you wanted to just slide up and down instead, we could do that. Comma, direction, vertical. This has to go in quotes because it's a word that JavaScript doesn't know, but it knows that one there. It knows what 2,000 is. All right, now if you do this, after two seconds, it's going to go vertical. We could do reverse true, so we'll go from top to bottom instead of from bottom to top. Reverse true. True is a word that JavaScript knows. Now it's going from the top to the bottom. Then finally, another one we could do is pause on hover true. Which is in here, you can find it in here somewhere pause on hover. There it is. We had set this, this is a feature that we had tried to build into our own version, that we did build into our own version. That's true, and when you're hovering over the slides, they'll stop. It's very nice interface on it, right? Now every two seconds, it's going to go unless I hover over the slides, in which case it's going to stop. It won't because I want to enjoy these kittens, I want to look at them for a while, two seconds isn't really long enough, so I can really enjoy them and look at them for as long as I want. Then, when I stop hovering on it, and I'll wait two seconds and it'll start going again. That functionality is built in as well. That's great. It gives us a lot of opportunity to build in a lot of extra functionality through these additional features that are here. There's a lot of them. Manual controls, controls container. You can do all kinds of things. There's arrows. You could swap those arrows out for something else, so that it doesn't look like every Website you go to has FlexSlider on it. It could look the same, because they all have the same arrows here, left and right arrows. We can get rid of those and do something else that would be kind of interesting and fun.
 
Now that you've created the basic FlexSlider, with some advanced options, we can really do some different things with this FlexSlider. To do that, it's nice to keep the basic version working the way it is working, so that you have a version of that if you want to refer back to it. If you want to, you can duplicate that folder and create a new folder and change the name to something like KittensAdvanced, or something like that. You can see over here, I have actually changed mine here. I don't need that folder anymore, close that one, but I just duplicated and called it advancedSlider. This set of files is currently exactly the same as that set of files. But I've made a copy so that I have this version if I want to refer back to it, but I'm essentially done with it. Now I'm only going to work on the advancedSlider version here. I have that version, these files open in my code editor. I've also switched this over here so that it's pointing to my advancedSlider folder here, so that I know that I'm working with the right set of files. Make sure you're working with the right set of files in your browser. Make sure you've got the right set of files in your code editor. Over here you can see it says advancedSlider there, so this is my advanced slider files. Great. Now that I've got that into place and I'm ready to really do some different things with this FlexSlider, the first thing I want to do is, I want to have a fancier version where, I actually have some content on top of each slide. Like we did with the JavaScript version of the slider, where we had a div on top with the heading and a paragraph in there. Then these slides, the actual pictures, were background images on the slides. I'm also going to have an animated Call the Action button, that will drop down and make it really clear that, what you should do is adopt one of these kittens on this lovely Kitten page. I need to update the markup to go along with this, for my FlexSlider. I will provide some snippets with this lesson that you can open and they look like this. There's some snippets here and so I'm basically going to replace my slider with this content here. You can type it all out if you wanted to, instead of just putting the pictures in. I have a div, with an h2. The div has a class of slide 1, slide 2, slide 3, so on and so forth. Then I have the h1 and the h2 and I have an anchor tag with the class of CTA for Call the Action. A spin around the text, which I explain what that's going to do in a few minutes, that says these kittens are available now. This is going to be like a Call the Action button that you can click on to access these kittens. It's not really going anywhere because the link is just set to a pound sign. But if this is a real website, that could be a link to a page where you could actually adopt this kitten or something like that, that will be fun. But rather than make you type all of this stuff out, which is tedious, you can actually come to the snippet page and just copy it. Then come back to your project and on your index file, in place of the slider down here, this FlexSlider, we're just going to paste this one in instead. Paste that in and it's still div class backsliders, still your old class slides. All that's changed is the list items in here. These divs have a class of slide1, slide 2, slide 3, slide 4 and slide 5. I dump slide 6 and 7 for now, probably five kittens is enough for this slider and that's great. That gets us started and on our way with creating our fancier version of our FlexSlider. In the next video, we'll start looking at what we need to do to adjust the styling for this.
 
In the last video, we updated the markup for our fancy version of the slider, and now we need to do some updating for the actual CSS for the display of the slides. So I'm going to come back over here to my snippets and I'm just going to copy these three rules here. And I'm going to come over and paste them into my CSS file over here, styles.css. And I'm going to stick them just in my section with the flex slider stuff here. It doesn't really matter where they go, I'm going to put them here. Now, this is really important, the slides the .slide1, .slide2, .slide3, that corresponds to these divs, div class slide3, slide4. They're going to get a background image. Each one is going to get a different background image, the background image is positioned at the top left and said not to repeat. Now, one thing that's important about this particular slider that you have to remember is that it's flexible, that's why it's called flex slider. And it will work for responsive websites and you can make these slides bigger or smaller. So we have to pay attention to the proportions of the slides, from their horizontal width to their vertical height. What is the proportion there? We want to keep the slides in proportion so that if they resize on the screen, they resize proportionally. And keeping track of proportions is a little bit tricky in CSS currently, there's some features coming to CSS that will make it easier in the long run, but for right now it's a little clidgy and unfortunate. But basically what I've done here is I've said the div that's inside these list items, I'm going to make it a width 100% position relative because I'm going to absolutely position some stuff inside of it. And I set the padding on the bottom to 50%, and it could be either padding top or padding bottom and background size cover. And essentially the height of these, and I probably should add in here, height 0. Height 0, add that in as well. Because the height is 0 but the padding on the bottom is 50%. These images happen to be twice as wide as they are tall. And that's why the padding is bottom 50%. In this case the padding is relative to the width. So as wide as these things are, they will always be 50% as high. And these images are twice as wide as they are tall. So that actually works for these particular images. If I come back to the finder and look at these images, if I do CMD+I, You can see here that the dimensions of this image is 960 by 480, it's twice as wide as it is tall. But what if that were not the case? What if you had images that had a different ratio? You want to make sure all your images are the same size, but they might have a different ratio of height to width, and how do you find out what that is? One easy way of doing it is to open the image in Photoshop, if you have access to Photoshop. Or if you don't have access to Photoshop, you could use another image editor like GIMP is a good image editor that's free for Mac or Windows or Linux. But I can go in and find out here what this image size is. And if I want to find out what the ratio is, if I change this width to 100, notice that the height is 50. So that means the height is 50% of my width. Which means I need to set that margin top or margin bottom to 50%. Setting it to 100 doesn't give you a lot of resolution, but if you set it to 1000 it would be 50.0%, in this case it's exactly 50%. But if you had a different ratio for images, you might have 67.25 or something like that for the height to the width ratio. So that's a good place to find out what that ratio is. So that you would set the ratio By Photoshop. And you can set the width to whatever the height is in relation to the width. And then I've got background size cover. Then down here I'm setting the H2 to position absolute top 20 pixels, left 20 pixels, then I'm setting the color for that. So that's not too fancy. But that's an important thing to understand with the way that this is working. The next thing we need is the styling for the actual call to action buttons that are going to show up on the slides. If I save this like this, you'll see if I come back and test it, it's fine, but the call to action buttons won't work very well here. So there's my call to action button there and I need to fix that, but you can see that the background images have come in. These images are now in the background of my slide, rather than in the foreground. And the foreground is an H2 that's been absolutely positioned here. But now I need to style this call to action, and I'll do that in the next video
 
Now we're down to styling the call to action so that it displays properly on the page, and I have a rule for the dot CTA anchor tags, there's a lot of stuff in here, but you'll see why as we move forward and do this, but let's go ahead and add this rule to our style sheet. If you come over here, you can see that I have it here, it's a long one so, I made it, so you don't have to tighten it, you can just copy and paste it. I'll explain more about exactly why all these decorations are in here, but for right now, let's just added in over here. A few things to look at, it's set to display flex for the call to action, and that's making this anchor tag display flex, so that this [inaudible] of the span in here can get positioned in the vertical center. By setting that to display flex and align-item center, that will allow me to put that text in the vertical center of these called actions, these called actions are going to be round buttons, and I want the text to be in the vertical and horizontal center, so that allows us to do that. I'm just setting the height and the width to 25vw, which is viewport width, 25 percent of the viewport width, so these buttons will scale up and down with the size of the window, and you'll see that this is actually too large for the desktop, we will put in a rule down in the media queries to fix that in a minute. I'm also setting position absolute on these, because they're going to be absolute positioned from the right, and then bottom 100 percent means they're going to be positioned initially off the top of the screen. I'm setting bottom 100 percent that's going to push the bottoms of these up to 100 percent, the height of that parent element, and that's going to put them all the way off the top of the screen. When we come to the slide, they're going to animate down into the screen, you'll see in a minute as we finish this up. I'm setting a background color, border radius 50 percent is what makes them round, I'm putting a border on them with the color, and then text-align center, puts the text in the horizontal center, some padding, text-decoration, none gets rid of the underlying setting, the font family, the font size, 4vw is four percent of the viewport width, so again, the font it's going to resize based on how wide the screen is, and then also the color for the text. That's a lot of stuff.
We're going to do one more rule in here for light, and I'm setting a color in here, color, and I think I set it to, where did I set it to, ededed. The reason for that, it's a light gray, one of the slides is dark, so over here, I have a class of light on slide 4. You may have also wondered why on one of the slides I went up here, I went kitten 2 to kitten 6, and then four, and then five. Kitten 3, the colors on that one just don't work well with the colors for the text, so I swapped it to one  of the other ones. But for number 4 here, I wanted to make this text light, so, I put a different color in there and a different class for that one, that's all we need there for that, so that's really good and should make sense in our work. We need a couple more rules that are going to resize these elements for desktop and for mobile, so we need to add these rules into the media queries at the bottom of the style sheet, and we're just setting height, width, and font size. For the tablet-sized versions of the site, which is, screens that are 600 pixels and wider, I'm just going to set dot CTA with 20vw instead of 25, and height, same height, height 20vw. Because up here, it's setting it to 25, and that's going to get too large as my screen gets larger, so I'm going to just shrink it down just a little bit there, and then I'm setting the font size to a little bit smaller, I think is not what it was, yes, 3vw instead of 4vw, it's 3vw, and so bringing the font size down a little bit, 3vw. Then, when we get to the full-screen size for desktop, I need this again, and I'm just going to set it to a maximum size, because at this point the screen is going to be flexible anymore, so I want these to be set to a specific size, 150px, so it's not going to be flexible anymore, because if, this size or wider, it's always going to be this size, 150px, [inaudible] the [inaudible] , it's just 24 pixels. I'll set this 24 pixels. Great, circuits all of the styling in place for these, and if we go back and review the page, you'll see that the color [inaudible] isn't on the screen at all, it's going to be up here, I actually noticed down here at bottom 100 percent, so it is showing up. But this is the way they're going to look in end here, is round like this. If you go to number 4, slide 4, that one should be picking up the light class, and I don't know why it's not now. You know what, I think I put it on the wrong one. Let's fix that. Over here. Cut it from there and stick it on this one. That seems like it should be the right one. It's so cute, it's that one. I think they're just ededed, it should be right. It may need to be refreshed properly, but that's okay. Great, so you got that all in place. The last thing we need to do is get this animation to work.

Hello and welcome to our second module. In our third course in JavaScript. In this module, will look at scroll effects. Scroll effects are very popular these days and you see them a lot around the Web. Plus, we'll work on a project that will allow you to test your skills by bringing together, a lot of the scripts we've created so far, all together in one page. And that's a great way to test your skills, and see how you're doing with this. So, let's dive in, break out our code editors and our web browsers, and get started on this module.
 
Smooth scroll using jQuery. In the first part of this lesson, we're going to use jQuery to make a smooth scroll script so that when you click a link at the top of the page, it does a smooth scrolling action down further down the page. And I have an example page that you can download with example files and I have them open here and you'll notice if I click section one, it puts section one right at the top of the window. Currently this is just a scrolling page with a bunch of sections on here. And this is just basic html. If I click section to it, just put section two at the top of the page, you can see here the URL has pounds second in here. And if I go into my files and look at this, you can see that my links are just linked to these IDs pound first links to section ID first and pound second links to section links to the ID second down here, so on and so forth. And that's just basic HTML. But it doesn't provide a very good user experience because when you click on something it just pops to that section and you don't get the sense of it actually traveling there. So, interface element that's been popular for a long time now is to create a smooth scroll effect so that you can get the sense of traveling from one place to another place on a web page. And if it happens smoothly and quickly without a lot of interference, then it adds to the user experience. So we're going to do that using jQuery. The first thing we need to do is set the header so its position fixed. And if you go back to the files, you'll notice in the style sheet up here at the top, I have position fixed commented out. So if you remove that comment and save it and then come back and refresh the page, you'll notice that now the header is fixed to the top of the window and the section one has now bumped up to the top of the window. And that's because the header has now been taken out of the normal flow of the document. When you set something to position fixed, it's no longer part of the normal flow of the document and the document will ignore it because the top is set to zero and the left to set to zero. This header is now pinned to the top left position of the view port here. And it's set to with 100% so it will stretch across the entire window. So now you can see because it's slightly transparent that the images and every all the content is passing beneath this header. But you also notice that it's covering up part of section one. So we need to go back to our style sheet here and uncomment out this line here, remove that comment to set the padding on the body to top 200 pixels. And that will push that first section down and we need to do that because the header is no longer part of the normal flow of the document. So we need to push that first section down, hopes to get saved. No it didn't save padding top 200 pixels come back Refresh. I probably just need to yeah, there we go. When you refresh it doesn't necessarily put the page at the top of the window. But now you can see when I load the page fresh, it is loading it with 200 pixels padding, which allows this element here to be sitting below the header. But the headers out of the normal flow of the document. Okay, so with some basic CSS and some basic HTML out of the way, we can start working on our script and getting the interactivity to work properly.
